# Nootes
Simple e2e notes repository

Nootes works by using the lesser known cryptocode python cryptography library to encrypt user inputted text

The title is generated by hashing (with pycryptodome SHA3-512) the user inputted title, because having numerous random hash files in the repsitory will theoretically make it near impossible for an adversary to know which files are real and which are bogus

NOTE: This is not a serious tool. To my knowledge, neither libaries used have been audited by a third party. If you are up against anyone other than a casual onlooker, I suggest you find other software.

If you're having trouble getting it to work, try using       pip install cryptocode      in the shell
